## Unreleased

### Changes

- Update orchestra to use `clojure.spec.alpha`. Only specs registered by `clojure.spec.alpha` will be instrumented. Also added a dependency on `[org.clojure/spec.alpha "0.1.94"]`. See this [mailing list post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/clojure/10dbF7w2IQo/ec37TzP5AQAJ) for more details on the change. [#2](https://github.com/jeaye/orchestra/issues/2)
